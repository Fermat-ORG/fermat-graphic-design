## What is Fermat? [40 sec]

Fermat is a P2P Network, a Framework and a set of APPs:

The Fermat P2P Network interconnects mobile devices between each other in order to exchange information without needing to go through a centralized service.

The Fermat Framework is like WordPress, but running on a mobile device or desktop computer instead of a server. Except that it is not intended for building web sites, but to build decentralized financial applications.

The set APPs offers different products to end users (te permiten tener vos mismo el dinero / digital assets). 


## Let's look at how it works: [45 sec]

Developers build Fermat APPs re-using existing components and adding more components to the pool when needed. Developers own the components they build, meaning that they can attach a Micro-Use-License to each of them to later receive a stream of micro-payments from end users using APPs that needs those components.

Any legacy financial service provider or bitcoin / blockchain company can also add their components in order to be re-used and their services consumed within the Fermat APPs ecosystem. This gives end users the freedom to decide where to hold their crypto currency and digital assets: at their own device or at third party financial service providers.
