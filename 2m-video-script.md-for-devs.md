## What is Fermat?

Fermat is an Open Source Framework for developing P2P Android APPs. The system is open source and the framework is crypto currency and digital assets ready.

It's like Wordpress running on an Android device.

## Let's look at how it works: 

* Developers build Fermat APPs re-using existing components and adding more components to the pool when needed. 

* Developers own the components they build, meaning that they can attach a _Micro-Use-License_ to each of them to later receive a stream of micro-payments from end users using APPs that needs those components.

Fermat already has a network of developers, designers, academics and artists working on the project. 

## What are the advantages of building Fermat APPs?

* The biggest advantage is that you don't have to do it. The current network of developers working on the project is happy to write the code for you or your company, for free.

* Your APP will be P2P meaning that it won't need to go through any third party to exchange information. It can still go to your back-end web services to acces your core systems. 

* Your APP can easily handle both crypto currency and digital assets.

* Your APP can be cloned and re-used with a different look and feel but still going to your back-end services and by doing so, driving more adoption to your business.

* Your APP can include for free a number of ready to use functionality just by re-using already built components.
