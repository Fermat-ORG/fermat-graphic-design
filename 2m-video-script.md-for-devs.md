## What is Fermat?

Fermat is an open source software project that runs on android devices. This software can run Fermat APPs, which are like mobile APPs except that they run on top of Fermat. 

Technically, Fermat is a Framework, a p2p Network and an Ecosystem of Fermat APPs.  It is similar to WordPress, since the goal is to easily build Android APPs.  There are some differences though.  Fermat runs on Android devices instead of a server. It’s also not intended for building web sites, but to build and run Fermat APPs.

Fermat APPs use the Fermat p2p Network to exchange information. This makes them censorship resistant. 


## Let's look at how it works:

Fermat has an existing network of developers, designers, academics, and artists working on the project.  They have laid the initial groundwork in order to build APPs on top of Fermat.

Developers can build Fermat APPs re-using existing components.  Usually new Fermat APPs add more components to the pool to be further re-used.

Developers own the components they build, meaning that they can attach a Micro-Use-License to each of them to later receive a stream of micro-payments. These micro-payments are generated from end users using APPs that needed those components.

## What are the advantages of Fermat APPs to developers?

The biggest advantage is that you don't have to code it yourself. Currently there is a queue where you can add your proposed project, and if it’s a good fit, it can be coded for free by the current network of developers.

Your Fermat APP will be peer to peer, meaning that it won't need to go through any third party to exchange information between two devices. It can still go to your back-end web services to access your core systems.

Your APP will easily handle both cryptocurrency and digital assets. This opens up your market to the entire world.

Your APP can be cloned and re-used with a different look and feel but still going to your back-end services.  By doing so, this will drive more adoption and users to your business.  The goal of this feature is to reach niche audiences globally.

Your APP will be open source meaning that anyone can check the code and review it.

Your APP can include any of the already built functionality just by re-using already built components.
