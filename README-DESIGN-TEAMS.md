## Compensation

Designers and team leaders in particular are classified by the deepness of the hierarchy that lies below them. The following table shows the categories related to compensation:

| # | Category | Description |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----| 
| 1 | Part-Time Entry Level | Part-Time Entry Level designer on the project. |
| 2 | Part-Time Veteran | Working part-time 6+ months OR high performant. |
| 3 | Entry Level | full-time designer on the project. |
| 4 | Veteran | (Working full time 3+ months OR high performant) AND highly engaged. |
| 5 | New Team Leader | Team Leader with 1 full-time member on the team. |
| 6 | Team Leader | Team Leader with less than 5 full-time members on the team. |
| 7 | Full Team Leader | Team Leader with 5 full-time members on the team. |
| 8 | New Parent Team Leader | Team Leader of a team with one sub-team. |
| 9 | Parent Team Leader | Team Leader of a team with many sub-teams. |
| 10 | Full Parent Team Leader | Team Leader with 5 sub-teams. |



### The following rules apply:

1. Standard team size is of 5 full-time members.
2. One full-time member can be replaced by 2 part-time members.
3. Designers can go up the category list and they can also go down in certain circumstances.
4. Going up or down a category is decided by the designer's team leader or parent team leader according to these rules.
5. To move up one category or to keep the current one, all the conditions of previous categories need to have been met.
6. To be _awarded_ means to win at least a 10% of a bounty by partnering with a dev-team that wins the full bounty.
7. When a criteria is met to go up a category, the designer will be moved up the following calendar month.
8. When a full team has a child sub-team leaded by one of the current members:<br>
    a. Their current team leader must add a full-time designer within the same month in order to keep his category.<br>
    b. Failing to do so, will move him down the next month to _Team Leader_.<br>
    c. Succeeding to get a full-time member will probably move him to _New Parent Team Leader_ if this was his first child.<br>
9. Team leaders can remove members from their teams with a reasonable cause (lack of engagement, performance, etc.).<br>
